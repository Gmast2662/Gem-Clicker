## 🎮 How to Play

### Getting Started

1. **Click the gem** in the center to mine gems manually
2. **Purchase upgrades** in the "Click Upgrades" tab to mine more gems per click
3. **Buy generators** in the "Generators" tab to mine gems automatically
4. **Watch your gem count grow!**

### Early Game Tips

- Focus on **click upgrades** first to get more gems per click
- Buy your first **Miner** (costs 15 gems) as soon as you can
- Each generator produces gems automatically every second
- Balance between click upgrades and generators for optimal growth

### Mid Game Strategy

- Start diversifying your generators - each one is more powerful than the last
- **Crystal Caves** and **Deep Shafts** provide massive production boosts
- Keep upgrading your mining tools for better manual clicking
- Watch for achievements to track your progress!

### Late Game & Prestige

- When progress slows down, consider **Prestiging**
- Prestige requires 1 million total gems earned
- You'll lose all gems and generators BUT gain **Prestige Points**
- Each Prestige Point gives a permanent **+1% bonus** to ALL gem production
- Your first prestige is the biggest boost - don't be afraid to reset!

## ⭐ Prestige System

### When to Prestige?

- You can prestige after earning **1 million total gems** (all-time)
- Each prestige grants **Prestige Points** based on your total gems earned
- Formula: √(total earned / 1,000,000) = Prestige Points
- Each point gives a **permanent +1% bonus** to all production

### Prestige Examples:

- 1M gems earned → 1 Prestige Point → +1% bonus
- 4M gems earned → 2 Prestige Points → +2% bonus
- 9M gems earned → 3 Prestige Points → +3% bonus
- 100M gems earned → 10 Prestige Points → +10% bonus

**Tip:** Your first prestige happens around 1M gems and gives you +1% forever. The bonus compounds with each prestige!
